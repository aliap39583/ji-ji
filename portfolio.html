	<h3><p style="font-family:'Calibri'"><font color="#d9b578"><font size="6"> Our first project was for the user to customize and design their own house. The customizations include name of the house, color of the house, choose between having a concrete front yard or grass yard, color and shape of the roof, shape of the window, and adding a pool. We set conditional statements to allow the customizations to work. Using iteration, a turtle swims in the users pool in the end of running the program.</font></h3>

	<h3><p style="font-family:'Calibri'"><font color="#d9b578"><font size="6"> We created a drawing competition between  two players for three rounds. After a round the players would decide who they believe to have the best drawing and add the score to the player by clicking on a turtle next to their score. They are given three different prompts and after the game ends it will display which player won the game.</font></h3>

	<h3><p style="font-family:'Calibri'"><font color="#d9b578"><font size="6"> We created a sandwich shop game where a customer asks for a random sandwich and the user has to click on the right ingredients for the sandwich. If the ingredients match the customer's request, you get a dollar and if not, you get it wrong and have 3 chances before the game ends.</font></h3>

	<h3><p style="font-family:'Calibri'"><font color="#d9b578"><font size="6"> In this project we graphed the data given by PLTW to figure out which location the rover was at. We decided that the rover had landed in a forest because of ambient light, constant sounds, small movement, and moderate temperature. </font></h3>
